 * the application launches in the app delegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.
 *
 * Initialisation can fail for several reasons, for example the provided application name is invalid, or
 * if the network connection is not functioning. Your application should inspect the NSError object that
 * is returned in the failure block of this method and decide whether it is possible to recover. This might
 * mean listening for when the network connection status changes so that the application can attempt to
 * register again.
 *
 * @param key The application key provided by TapPoint. This is case sensitive.
 * @param failureBlock Block called when initialisation fails. This block contains an NSError
 * argument describing the cause of the error.
